TRANSLA T IONS

X.

- SHE walks in beauty, like the night ’

Os cloudless elimes and starry skies,
And all that's best ofdark and bright
Meets in her aspect and her eyes,

’ Thus mellowed to that tendet light

Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had hals impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress
And softly lightens o’er her face,

Where thoughts serenely sweet express

How pure, how dear, their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o'er that brow
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,

The smiles that play, the tints that glow
But tell os days in goodness spent,

A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent.
