MARTIAL.

(ΕΡ. x. xxx.)

Ο balmy clime os Formiae's shore,

Thy sweet retreat, 'all else before, ’
Apollinaris loves, when down

He hurries srom the unresting Town. Ι
Not Tibur sweet, his wife's blest home,
Not Algidus, or Tusculum,

Praeneste, or the Antian shrine

Can win him back with charms like thine.
Gaieta, tomb of Dardan dame,

And Circe’s cape, bewitching name,
Delight no more, nor that bright wood
Marica hangs 0’er Liris' flood,

Or where the nymph Salmace laves

Her mineral in the Lucrine waves.

Here, only here, each gentle breeze

, Just stirs the mirror os the seaS,

And the gay gondola may ride

Upon this calmly-heaving tide

Before a wind no ruder than

The waving of a purple san,

In summer, when to lady sair

Comes the cool rush os wholesome air,
Nor on the distant deep your line

Need seek for treasures os the brine;
Just from your couch the bait you throw,
And see the fish bite far below.

But if King AEolus hold reign

Upon old Nereus’ watery plain,

The board all tempests can deride

Piled with the store itself supplied.
