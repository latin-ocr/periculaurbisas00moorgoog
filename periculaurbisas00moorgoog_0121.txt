' TO EVENING.

Is aught of oaten stop or pastoral song .
May hope, chaste Eve, to soothe thy modest ear
Like thy own solemn springs,
Thy springs„ and dying gales3

Ο Nymph reserved,-·while now the bright-hair’d sun
sits in yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts

With brede ethereal wove,

O‘erhang his wavy bed,

Now air is hush'd‚ save where the weak·eyed bat
With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing,
Or where the beetle winds

His small but sullen horn, “

As ost he rises 'midst the twilight path,
Against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum,-
Now teach me, maid composed‚

To breathe some sosten'd strain,

Whose numberS‚ stealing through thy dark'ning vale,
May not unseemly with its stillness suit ; ·

As musing slow 1 hail

Thy genial loved retum
