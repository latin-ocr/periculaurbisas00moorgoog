AND POEMS. 125

‘ And dost thou launch with wintry stars on high
‘ To cross the seas where Aquilo sweeps by?

‘ Hard man! if those thou seekest were thine own,
‘ Not alien lands and settlements unknown,

‘ And Ilium stood, sor ilium were it well

‘ To trust a navy to yon ocean swell.

‘ ’Tis me thou flyest! By these tears that flow,

‘ By thine own troth,-n0 more is left me now-
‘ Oh Ι , by that primal hour that made us one,

‘ By all our marriage rites but now begun,

‘ By all thou ow’st me, all my love has been,

‘ Pity the downsall of a ruined Queen,

‘ And turn thee from thy purpose! 'Tis for thee
⁴ Tyrians estranged and Libyan hate I see,

‘ And ah! sole passport to the realms above,

‘ The name once mine is bartered sor thy love!

‘ Friend, in whose halls must I be left to pine?

‘ (Friend is the name, though husband once was thine)

‘ Am I to wait till fierce Pygmalion comes

‘ To wreak a brother's vengeance on 'these homes,

‘ Or the black Moor whom once Ι scorned to wed‚

‘ Iarbas, lead me to a c-aptive’s bed?

⁴ Oh! had I from thee, ere thou fled'st the place, ·

‘ Clasped to a mother’s breast one darling face, ’
’ ‘ One small AEneas in my halls at play,

‘ To look like thee, though thou art sar away,

‘ Captivities' dishonour had been less,

⁴ Nor ali unsoothed my widow’d loneliness'
