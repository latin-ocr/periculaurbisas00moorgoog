ΛΝΒ POEMS. 131

But prayers are powerless‚ tears too soft to move
The ear now deafened to the voice of love
By Fate’s resisting purpose. As the oak,
Which gales all buffet, grasps its Alpine rock,
And, hale with timber of a thousand springs,
Its quivering stem the rustling leaflets flings,
Deep carpeting the ground ; as high in air

It mounts above, as low ’tis rooted there ;

So the firm Hero felt in every part

Their prayers incessant vibrate to his heart ;
But, though perforce the idle teardrops roll,
No words unfix the purpose of his soul.

And now the Queen, by fates resistless driven,
Calls loud on Death, and loathes the vault of heaven:

Now, too, sad call to quit the shining skies,
A diresul sight defiles her sacrifice,

'And incensed shrines, where wine was poured before,

Stream with the blackening flow of soulest gore.
And yet such portent of her coming death

To none, not e'en to Anna, does she breathe.
Lo! where the Chapel to her lord of old
Within her palace stands, of marble mould, ,
Dressed in white coronals and festal sprays,
And all the honours that Affection pays,

She hears the accents of the sainted Dead

Call, when the darksome Night is overhead3
And the lone owl that oft on towers complains,
