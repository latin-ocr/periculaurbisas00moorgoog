TRANSLA TIONS

XVII.

STILL to be neat, still to be drest‚

· As you were going to a feast ;

Stil} to be powdered, still persumed:
Lady, it is to be presumed,

Though art’s hid causes are not found,
All is not sweet, all is not sound.

Give me a look, give me a face

That makes simplicity a grace ;

Robes loosely flowing, hair as sree;

¹ Such sweet neglect more taketh me

Than all the adulteries of art— Α
They strike mine eye, but not my heart.

BEN JONSON.
