‘Madwoman that I was—from ocean's grave

⁴ His shipmates rescued‚ kindliest shelter gave-

‘ Ah mel what fiery frenzy bears me on 1-

⁴ Now Lycian oracleS, now Jove’s own son

‘ Apollo speaks—descending from the skies,

‘ Heaven's message-bearer to the rescue flies,
‘And bears the startling mandate-such low care,
‘ Such labours vex those quiet Lords of air :-

‘ I combat not thy words, nor thee detain;

‘ Go, seek a kingdom o’er yon billowy main,

‘ Let the winds find thee Italy! Yet then,

‘ Ι1 Mercy can avenge the crimes 01 men,

‘While rocks and mountain breakers round thee roar,
‘ The name 01 Dido oft shalt thou implore:

‘ Ι shall be near thee in dark smouldering fires,
‘And when my Spirit in cold Death expireS,

‘ My shadowy Form shall never leave thy track:
‘ Then, perjured Trojan, shalt thou pay me back ;
‘ And, as Ι listen far below, shall come

‘ To the great Dead the message 01 thy doom !'
Abrupt she ends and flying from the day,

She leaves him there, nor lists what he may say,
But saint with force of passion, tears herself away.
Her maidens bear her swooning as she goes

Back to her marble chamber for repose.

Deep groans the good AEneas, and for love
The firm foundations 01 his purpose move;
