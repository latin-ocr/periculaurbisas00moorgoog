TRANSLA TIONS

rrrv.

WE lest behind the painted buoy
That tosses at the harbour mouth,
And madly danced our hearts for joy
As fast we fleeted to the south ;
How sresh was every sight and sound
On open main or winding shore;
We knew the merry world was round
And we might sail sor evemrore.

How ost we saw the sun rethe,

And burn the threshold os the night,
Fall srom his ocean-lane of fire,

And sleep beneath his pillared light
How ost the purple-skirted robe

Of twilight slowly downward drawn,
As thro’ the slumber os the globe

Again we dashed into the dawn!

New stars all night above the brim
Of waters lightened into view;
They climbed as quickly, for the rim
Changed every moment as we flew;
Far ran the naked moon across

The houseless ocean’s heaving field,
Or flying shone, the silver boss
Or her own halo’s dusky shield.
