Τ RANSLA Τ IONS

XI.

AT the last limits os our isle,
Washed by the western wave,
Touched by thy sate, a thoughtful bard

Sits lonely on thy grave.

Pensive he eyes, before him spread,
The deep outstretched and vast 3

His mourning notes are borne away
Along the rapid blast

And while, amid the silent dead,
Thy hapless sate he moums,
His own long sorrows lreshly bleed,

And all his grief returns.

Like thee, cut off in early youth
And flower os beauty's pride,
His friend, his first and only joy,
His much-loved Stella, died.

Him, too, the stern impulse os Fate
Resistless bears along3

And the same rapid tide shall whelm
The poet and the song.
