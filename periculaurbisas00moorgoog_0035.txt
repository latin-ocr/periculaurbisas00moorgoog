¹IX.

AND Lo, he sat on horseback at the door!

And near him the sad nuns with each a light
Stood‚ and he gave them charge about the Queen,
To guard and foster her sor evermore.

And while he spoke to these his helm was lowered,
To which sor. erest the golden Dragon clung

Os Britain; so she did not see the sace,

Which then was as an angel's‚ but she saw,

Wet with the mists, and smitten by the lights,
The Dragon of the great Pendragonship

Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire.

And even then he turned; and more and more
The moony vapour rolling round the King,

‘ Who seemed the phantom of a giant in it,

Enwound him sold by sold, and made him gray
And grayer, till hImself became as mist
Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom.

TENNYSON‚ Guinevere.
