AND POEMS. 133

⁴ Turns on vast Atlas’ shoulders: in those gladeS,
⁴ Guarding the precinct of the Evening Mans,

‘ A priestess of Massylia, found by me,

⁴ Has kept the fruit upon its sacred tree,

‘ And o’er the Dragon's banquet daily spread

⁴ The slumb'rous poppy seed, and honeyed mead.
⁴ Hers is the power in these to ease the heart,

⁴ On those to fix the agonizing smart 3

⁴ To stay the rushing of a torrent's wrath,

⁴ Or turn a planet backward on its path.

⁴ Forth at her chant the midnight Manes troop‚

⁴ Down srom the mountain tops the ashes stoop,
⁴ And loud the earth moans under ;-not that Ι

⁴ Would fain have armed me with this sorcery—
⁴ Ι swear it, sister, by thine own dear love,

⁴ Swear it by all the powers that move above!

⁴ But thou must rear within my unroofed hall

¹ ⁴ The pyre that fits a secret funeral;

⁴ Bring frorn that chamber whence the false one fied
⁴ The marriage couch where Modesty lies dead,

⁴ Garments and armour too: she bids the flame

⁴ Take all of him I never more must name.¹

She spoke, and silence leaves her features pale.
Yet Anna bodes no mischief from her tale:
In such new rites of love she cannot find

All the mad cunning of her sister's mind,
But hurries to her task ;—no more to sear

Than when she mourned o’er dead Sychaeus' bier.
