T RANSLA TIONS

XXV.

YET a few dayS, and thee
The all-beholding Sun shall see no more
ln all his course: nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many team,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Barth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth to be resolved to earth again:
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou g0,
To mix lor ever with the elements ;
To be a brother to the insensible rock,
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad and pierce thy mould‚

Yet not to thine eternal resting·place

Shalt thou retire alone—Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world-with kingS,
The powersul of the earth-the wise, the good,
Fair sormS, and hoary seers of ages past,

All in one mighty sepulchre.
W. S. annnr.
