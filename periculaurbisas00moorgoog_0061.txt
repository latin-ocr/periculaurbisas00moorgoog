Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,
Sprinekled with perle, and perling flowres atweene‚
Doe 'lyke a golden mantle her attyre;

- And being erowned with a girland greene,

Seem lyke some mayden queene.

Her modest eyes, abashed to behold

So many gazers as on her do stare,

Upon the lowly ground affixed are;

Ne dare list up her countenance too bold,

But blush to hear her prayses sung so lond,

So farre from being pronde.

Nathlesse doe ye st'ill loud her prayses sing,

That all the woods may answer‚ and your eccho ring.

SPENSER, Epithalamium.
