TRANSLATJONS

For when thy sowing-star arising shows
His paly circlet, at his warning lamp
The fragrant Hours, and Elves
ι Who slept in buds the day,

And many a Nymph who wreathes her brows with
sedge
And sheds the freshening dew, and lovelier still

The pensive Pleasures sweet
Prepare thy shadowy car.

Then let me rove some wild and heathy scene ;
Or find some ruin 'midst its dreary dells,

Whose walls more awful nod
By thy religious gleams

Or if chill blustering winds, or driving rain
Prevent my willing feet, be mine the hut
That, from the mountain side
Views wilds and swelling floods,
