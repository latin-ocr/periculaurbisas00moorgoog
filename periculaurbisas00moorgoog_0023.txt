So WAS HE lifted gently from the ground,

And with their freight homeward the shepherds move
Through the dull mist, Ι following-when a step,

A single step, that freed me from the skirts

Of the blind vapour, opened to my view,

Glory beyond all glory ever seen

By waking sense, or by the dreaming soul !

The appearance, instantaneously disclosed,

Was of a mighty City-boldly say

A wilderness of building, sinking far

And sels-withdrawn into a wondrous depth,

Far sinking into splendour-without end!

Fabric it seemed of diamond and of gold,

With alabaster domeS, and silver spirea

And blazing terrace upon terrace, high

Uplifted; here, serene pavilions bright‚

In avenues disposed; there, towers begirt

With battlements that on their restless fronts

Bore stars—illumination os all gems!

By earthly nature had the effect been wrought

Upon the dark materials of the storrn

Now pacified 3 on them, and on the eoves

And mountain-steeps and summitS, whereunto

The vapours had receded, taking there

Their station under a caerulean sky.
Wonnswonrn.
