TRANSLATIONS

As generations come and go,

Their art, their customs, ebb and flow;
Fate, fortune, sweep strong powers away,
And seeble, os themselves, decay;

What poor abodes the heir-loom hide,

In which the castle once took pride!

Tokens, once kept as boasted wealth,

Is saved at all, are saved by stealth

Lo! ships from seas by nature barred,
Mount along ways by man prepared ;
And in sar-stretching vales, whose streams

Seek other seas, their canvas gleams.
