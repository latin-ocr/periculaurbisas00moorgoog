TRANSLA TIONS

XVI.

Ο SWALLOW‚ swallow, flying, flying south,
Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded caves,
And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.

Ο ten hu, swallow, thou that knowest each,
That bright and fierce and fickle is the south,

And dark and true and tendet is the north.

O swallow, swallow, if Ι could follow and light
Upon her lattice, Ι would pipe and trill,
And chirp and twitter twenty million loves.

ι O were Ι thou that she might take me in
And lay me in her bosom, and her heart
Would rock the snowy cradle‚ till I died.

Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,
Delaying as the tendet ash delays
To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?

O tell her, swallow, that thy brood is flown.
Say to her I do but wanton in the south,
But in the north long since my nest is made.
