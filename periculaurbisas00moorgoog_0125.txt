116 TRANSLA TIONS

And hamlets brown, and dim-discover'd spires; Α
And hears their simple bell ; and marks o'er all
Thy dewy fingers draw
The gradual dusky veil.

While Spring shall pour his showers, as oft he wont,
And bathe thy breathing tresseS, meekest Evel

While Summer loves to sport

Beneath thy lingering light ; .

While sallow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves;
Or Winter, yelling through the troublous air,
Affrights thy shrinking train
And rudely rends thy robes ;

So long, regardiul of thy quiet rule,

Shall Faney, Friendship‚ Science, smiling Peace,
Thy gentlest influence own
And love thy favourite name!

W. CoLuNs.
