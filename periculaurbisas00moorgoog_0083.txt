TRANSLA TIONS

XXVIII.

Ἴ O FRIEND, it seems, when first our lives begin,
When we, fresh mariners, first hoist the sail‚
On favouring seas by savouring breezes borne,
As though the bark of our felicity

Could never be ornately trimmed enough,

Nor be enough lull-freighted with delights;

As though each thing we wanted were a wrong
Done to us ;——so we loosen from the land.

But what another lesson will anon

Be learned ; and of them who claimed so much,
Deeming it all too little for their needS,

Some will be thankful is one broken plank

Ol all their tempest·shattered bark remain,

¹ Bearing them up above the salt-sea loam

Of this world's infelicity to shore.
