xxiv.

A erius. GET you from me!
Is not the doom of Caesar on this body?
Do Ι not bear my last hour her'e now sent me?
Am not I old Aecius ever-dying?
You think this tenderness and love you bear me,
’Tis treason and the strength os disobedience,
And is ye tempt me further ye shall seel it.
I seek the camp sor sasety! when my death, ἵ
Ten times more glorious than my life and lasting
Bids me be happy! let the fool sear dying.
Ae'cius is not now to learn to suffer.
If ye dare shew a just affection, kill me ;
I wait but those that must. Why do ye weep?
Am I so wretched to deserve men's pities?
Go give your tears to those who lose their worths,
Bewail their miseries: sor me wear garlands,
Drink wine, and much; sing paeans to my praise':
I am to triumph, friends, and more than Caesar,
For Caesar sears to die: Ι love to die.

Bnnunonn nnn ancmm, Valentinian.
