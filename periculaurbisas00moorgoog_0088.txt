Ν AND noeirs,

And serve for ever in their base employ,
Because forsooth Ι helped them in their need,
And Trojan hearts can ne'er forget the deed.
Ii thou couldst dare it, what triumphant iord
Will take an alien on his proud shipboard?
Thou know’st not yet, though ruined and aione,
The perjured sons of false Laomedon.

Shail 1 with those wild crews unguarded go?
Or press with all my Tyrians on the foe,
Urging once more upon the wind-swept ioam
Men torn unwilling from their Sidon home?
No, die, as thou deservest l—It will sever,
The unfiinching steel, thine agony for ever.

'Twas thou, my sister‚'wh0m my tears could move

In that mad moment of my rising love,

To plunge me headlong in this depth oi woe,
And unprotected hurled me on the foe.
’Twas not ior me to lead the wild-wood life,

, And never know the bondage oi a wife,

Nor e’en to keep the promise that Ι gave

In the last parting 0’er Sychaeus’ grave.
