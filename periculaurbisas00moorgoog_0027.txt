THEN I:
‘Follow me, O most miserable men Γ
And, speaking, I began to 1001 the waste
Backward, toward the city: all the while
Fearing to look behind me, like a man
Wh0‚ being made against his will to walk
At midnight through a charnel, walks in haste,
Dogged by the'unseen forms 01 his own fears.
I saw no cloud ; and yet the winds arose.
The faint light 01 the unfathomable heavens,
Thick-sown with shivering stars, made the dark plain
Darker. And infinite the darkness seemed.
Sometimes cold gleams from bare gray sepulchres
And ghastly ruins broke the boundless gloom:
Sometimes, upstarting, spectral aqueducts
Ran by us, and plunged headlong down the night:
Far off, at times, the wail 01 windy reeds
I heard; and heard, at times, high overhead
The howlet’s cry; at times, beneath my foot

The cavernous ground gave forth a hollow groan.
