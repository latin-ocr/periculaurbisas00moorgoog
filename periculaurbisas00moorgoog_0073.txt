My pulse, as yours doth temperately keep time,

And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That Ι have uttered: bring me to the test,

And I the matter will re-word: which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, sor love os grace
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul‚
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks.
It will but skim and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption ruining all within

Infects unseen,
Hamlet, Act III. Scene lv
