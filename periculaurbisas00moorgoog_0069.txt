BIRD¹ os the greenwood
Ο why art thou here?
Leaves dance not o’er thee,
Flowers bloom not near.
All the sweet water
Far hence is at play,
2 Bird os the greenwood
Away, away!

Where the mast quivers
v Thy place will not be,

As midst the waving

Os wild-rose and tree.
How shouldst thou battle
With storm and with spray.
Bird os the greenwood
Away, away!

Or art thou secking
Some brighter land
Where by the south wind

Vine leaves are fanned?
Midst the wild bi·l!ow

Why then delay?
Bird os the greenwood
Away, away!
