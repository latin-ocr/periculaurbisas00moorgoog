ΑΜ) PoEMs. 127

‘ In dreams oft warns me; ost the troubled look

‘ Os that pale spectre seems to speak rebuke.

‘And can I young Ascanius long detain

‘ From that great kingdom which the Fates ordain?
‘ ’Twas e’en but now from Jove came flying down,-
‘ By thy dear lise Ι swear it, and mine own,-

‘ Heaven’s message-bearer-—through the walls he trod
‘ Bright in the beaming halo os a god,

‘And these ears drani< his accents. Wish not so

‘ To rouse both thee and me to useless woe:

‘ By other will than mine to Italy Ι go?

His pleading ended there, but long before

Her silent eyes, quick-moving, swept him 0'er;
And now on him whom she had loved so late,
Turning, she spoke the burning words of hate :-

‘ No goddess woman was true dam os thine,

‘ No Dardanus the author of thy line ;

‘ On flints of Caucasus thy cradle stood,

‘And dug of Hyrcan tigress gave thee sood ἔ-

‘ Yes; sor 'tis folly longer to resrain!

‘ Can darker villany than this remain?

‘ Did all my sobs call forth one pitying sigh‚

‘ Or wring one tender teardrop from his eye?
‘And what shall indignation first record?

‘Now Heaven’s great Mistress and Saturnian Lord,
‘Look down on Right no longer: Faith is gone ;-—

‘Shipwrecked Ι took him, placed him on my throne,
