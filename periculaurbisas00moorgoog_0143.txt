134 TRANSLA TIONS AND POEMS.

The Queen within, where, towering to the shy,

With pine and oak the pyre is raised on high,
O'er her court walls the darkling garlands weaveS,
And decks her death-bed with funereal leaves;
Then, mindful of the issue, throws above

The sword‚ the garb, the image of her love.
Ranged are the altars, and the priestess there,
With locks dishevelled‚ peals the midnight prayer,
Calling on thrice a hundred names of fear,

On darkest ErebuS, and Chaos drear,

And virgin Hecate's nocturnal aid,

Three-figured Dian, triple-featured maid ;

While round about the watery charm she flings,
That mocks the spray of deep Avernus' springs.
For her dark spells the downy herb is¹ found
Cropp’d with brass falchion when the moon is round,
Juice os black poison, and from soal new-bom
The sorehead spot his mother has not torn¹

There too the Queen, with sost unsandelled tread,
And hands that wave the consecrated bread,
Along the altars' row ungirdled goes,

And calls the gods who can attest her woes,
Calls on the stars that far in ether glide,

The calm spectators of her suicide,

And that great Justice watching from above

The unequal bond of unrequited love.
