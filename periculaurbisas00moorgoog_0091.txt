TRAXslA Τ Ι OXS

From Syracuse a sound is sent,

And timet, dome, and battlement
Are ringing with the exulting cry

Os pm chanting victory:

And bmcon-fires are smoulden'ng still
On Euryelus’ castled hill,

And high upon Plemmyrium

Bid the Sicilian armies come,

To view the last expiring throe

01 their thrice-baffled captive s0e;
And srorn each inwardgazing glen
The dread alarm of coming men
Sounds o’er the marsh, where silently
Anapus wanders to the sea;

Or seems to sound: each airy breath
To that doomed army whispers death

Despair has hushed the piercing cry
That rose from thousands to the sky,
When Syracuse, but yesterday,

With one clear paean swept the bay,
And forward o'er the drowned and dying

Pressed on their ranks in panic flying,
As leaves os Autumn pale and sere

Are crowded on the wind-swept mere.
And he stands there, whom Athens sent
To be the unwilling instrument
