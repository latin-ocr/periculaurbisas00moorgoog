FAREWELL! on wings os sombre stain
That blacken in the last blue skies
Thou fly’st; but thou wilt come again
On the gay wings of butterflies.
Spring on thy approach will sprout

· Her new Corinthian beauties out, ,

Leaf-woven homes, where twitter words
Will growto songS, and eggs to birds.
Ambitious buds shall swell to flowers ’
And April smiles to sunny hours; ’
Bright days shall be, and gentle nightS,
Full of solt breathand echo lights,

’ As is the god os suntime kept

His eyes hals open while he slept.

Ι Roses shall be where roses were

Not shadOWS, but reality3

As is they never perished there

But slept in immortality.

Nature shall thrill with new delight,

And Time’s relumined river run

. Warm as young blood, and dazzling bright‘
As is its source was in the Sun.
