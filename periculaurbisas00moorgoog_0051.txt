TRANSLA TIONS

XV.

RISEST thou thus, dim dawn, again,

So loud with voices of the birds,
So thick with lowings of the herdS,
Day, when Ι lost the flower os men;

Who tremblest thro’ thy darkling red
On yon swoll’n brook that bubbles sast
By meadows breathing of the past,

’ ’ And woodlands holy to the dead ;

Who murmurest in the foliaged caves
A song that slights the coming care,
And Autumn laying here and there

A fiery finger on the leaves;

Who wakenest with thy balmy breath
To myriads on the genial earth,
Memories of bridal or of birth,

And unto myriads more, of death.

Ο wheresoever those may be,
Betwixt the slumber of the poleS,
To-day they count as kindred souls;
They know me not, but mourn with me.

TENNYSON, In Memoriam.
