Ι 106 TRANSLATIONS ,

So the two brothers and their murdered man
Rode past fair Florence, to where Amo's stream
Gurgles through straightened banks, and still doth fan
, Itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream
Keeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan
The brothers' faces in the ford did seem ;
Lorenzo’s flush with love. They passed the water
Into a forest quiet for the slaughter.

They told their sister hoW, with sudden speed‚
Lorenzo had ta'en ship for foreign lands,
Because of some great urgency and need
In their affairs, requiring trusty hands.

Poor girl! put on thy stifling widow's weed,
And ’scape at once from Hope’s accursed band;
To=day thou wilt not see him, nor to·morroW‚
And the next day will be a day of sorrow.
