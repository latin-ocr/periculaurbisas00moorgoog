T RA NSLA TI ONS

While scarlet poppies blush beneath the shade,
And silver lilies deck the watery glade.

Young Hylas, as he plucks the flowery spoil,

Forgets his task sor this more pleasing toll ε
Next at the spring, all unsuspecting, stays,
And in the mirrored reflex loves to gaze 3
Then dips his hand a copious draught to drink,
One shoulder testing on the mossy brink.
’Twas then his beauty fired the nymphs 'at play
Τό leave the dance they love, and haste away;
Gently they draw him down the yielding rill;
A little splash-and all around is still. ¹

³ Afar Alcides calle his love to save,

But nought save Echo answers from the wave.
