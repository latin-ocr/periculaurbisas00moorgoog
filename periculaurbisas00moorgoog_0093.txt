TRANSLATIONS

Round his dear neck their arms are flinging,
And wildly calling on their love

With eries and tears that may not move,

'Till seebly sinking in despair,

They pour to Heaven their latest prayer.

The last sarewell is over now,
And they move sorward, mute and slow.
But ever Memory recalls
That voyage froin bright Athenian walls,
And hopes that grasped in victory
All treasures of the Western sea;
And then the days which cast their brave
To welter on the harbour wave.
Or slain in fight, no burial given,
To lie beneath the unpitying heaven.
And last the flight srorn that dread shore
To ills perhaps unknown before
O'erpowers thern: and the starting tear
Speaks os the woes too hard to bear.
But Nicias’ voice is ever by ·
To cheer their deep despondency.
‘For ills ye cannot now retrieve‚
‘Forbear, my countrymen‚ to grieve;
‘ F orbear the unavailing tear
‘For those beyond the reach of sear.-
‘The wings os Nemesis which over
‘The invading squadron darkly hover,
