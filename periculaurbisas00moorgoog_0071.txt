Vernon. I SAW young Harry, with his beaver on,
His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armed,
Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury‚
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
Asis an angel dropped down srom the clouds
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.

Hotspur. No more, 110 more: worse than the sun

in March

, This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
They come like sacrifices in their trim‚

And to the fite-eyed maid of smoky war

All hot and bleeding will we offer them.
