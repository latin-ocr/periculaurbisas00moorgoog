VII.

SOME sretful tempers wince at ev’ry touch,
You always do too little or too much:

You speak with life, in hopes to entertain,
Your elevated voice goes through the brain3

You fall at onceinto a lower key,

That's worse—the drone·pipe os an humblebee.
The southern sash admits too strong a light,
You rise and drop the curtain—now 'tis night.
He shakes with sold—you stir the fire and strive
'l'o make a blaze—that’s roasting him alive.
Serve him with venison, and he chooses fish ;
Withsole—that's just the sort he would not wish:
He takes what he at first professed to loath, “
And in due time seeds heartily on both ;’

Yet still o'erclouded with a constant frown

He does not swallow, but he gulps it down.
Your hope to please him vain on ev'ry plan,
Himself should work that wonder is he can-
Alas! his efforts double his distress,

He likes yours little, and his own still less.

Thus always teasing others, always teased,

His only pleasure is-—to be displeased.

COWPER, Conversation.
