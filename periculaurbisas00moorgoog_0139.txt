‘ Anna! thou see’st their crowds upon the seas,

‘ The sterns are wreathed, the canvas calls the breeze.
‘ Sore is this pang, yet Ι foresaw the blow,

⁴ And to the issue can endure it now.

‘ Yet, sister, grant me this: to thee alone

‘The inmost thoughts of that salse Man are known ;
‘The quiet paths that steal upon his mind,

‘ And all his yielding moments, thou canst find.

‘ Go, sister, and the soeman meeldy tell,

⁶ I ne’er sent ships ’gainst Troy's high cltadel;
‘Death to the race of Troy I never swore‚

‘ With banded Danat on the Aulis shore ;

‘ His fathers bones Ι never bore away,

‘That he should thus be deal to all Ι pray.

‘ Where flies he? Let him walt-'tis love’s last prayer,—
‘ Till ssight is easy, and the winds are fair.

⁴ I ask not now the wedlock Ι have lost,

‘ Or that he stay from his fair Latian coast,

‘And lose his destined kingdom: my behest

‘ Is but one span of respite and os rest,

‘ Till Fortune, mistress o'er my vanquished will,
‘ Shall teach me too to suffer and be still.
‘ Pity thy sister, grant the boon Ι ask ;-
‘ And Death shall pay thee double lor the task.'

Such was her prayer, pathetic with her tears,
And such her sister, oft returning, bears.
