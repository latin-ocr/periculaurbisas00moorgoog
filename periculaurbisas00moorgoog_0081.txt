TRANSLA TIONS

XXVII.

Ocoon. HE sunk to the abyss? to the darkovoid? “
Apollo. An eagle so, caught in some bursting cloud
On Caucasus3 his thunder-baffled wings

ξ ’ Entangled in the whirlwind, and his eyes

Which gazed on the undazzling sun, now blinded
By the white lightning, while the ponderous hail
Beats 'on his struggling form, which sinks at length,
Prone, and the a'e'rial ice clings over it.

SHELLEY, Prometheus Unbound.
