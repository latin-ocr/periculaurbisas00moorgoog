She finished. He, Jove’s mandates to obey,

F ixed on the ground his calm unwandering eye:
The struggling care that on his heartstrings broke
He smothered there, and thus in brief he spoke :-
‘Never, my Queen, shall aught forgotten be

‘ Of that uncounted debt I owe to thee,

⁶ Never but sweet shall be Eliza's name,

⁴ While sense and breath shall animate this frame.
‘ Bries will Ι plead. Imagine not that Ι

‘ Hoped to steal hence in coward secrecy.'

⁴ Thee with the marriage torch I never lured,

⁴ Nor signed such contracts with my plighted word.
‘ Is Fate had given me to repose my lise

⁶ E'en where Ι would, and end this weary strise,

‘ The smoking ruins of my own dear Troy

‘ To saise, to eherish, were my lasting joy;

‘ Priam's high halls in ancient state should stand,
‘ And a new F ortress guard the vanquished land.
⁴ Not such Heaven’s will: ltalia was the name,

⁴ When from the Grynian god that mandate came,
⁴ The Lycian oracles Italia sing:

‘ She is my love, my home from wandering.

‘ The towers os Carthage and a Libyan hearth
‘Thou lov'st to keep, yet Tyrians gave thee birth ;
‘ And shall not Teucer's son at freedom fly

⁴ To seek new homes beneath Ausonia’s sky.
‘ Me too a father’s form, what time the night
‘ Spreads the dank shades, and stars rise fiery bright,
