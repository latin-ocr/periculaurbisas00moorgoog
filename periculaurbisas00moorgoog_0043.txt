TRANSLA TIONS

XIII.

TO fair Fidele's grassy tomb
Sost maids and village hinds shall bring
Each opening sweet os earliest bloom‚
· And rifle all the breathing spring.

¹ No wailing ghost shall dare appear

To vex with shrieks the quiet grove,
But shepherd lads assemble here
And melting virgins own their love.

No withered witch shall here be seen,
No goblins lead their nightly crew ;

The female lays shall haunt the green,
And dress thy grave with pearly dew.

The redbreast oft at evening hours
Shall kindly lend his little aid,

With hoary moss and gathered flowers,
To deck the ground where thou art laid.

When howling winds and beating rain
In tempest shake the sylvan cell,
Or midst the chase, on every plain,
The tender thought on thee shall duell.

Each lonely scene shall thee restore,
For thee the tear be duly shed,
Beloved till Life can charm no more,
And mourned till Pity’s sels be dead.
Connus.
