T RANSLA T IONS

VIII.

TEARS, idle tears, I know not what they mean;
Tears from the depth of some divine despair
Rise in the heart' and gather to the eyes

In looking on the happy Autumn fields.

And thinking os the daysthat are no more.
Fresh as the first bearn glittering on a sail,
That brings our friends up from the underworld,
Sad as the last which reddens over one

That sinks with all we love below the verge ;
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.
Ah! sad and strange, as in dark summer dawns
The earliest pipe os hals-awakened birds

To dying ears, when unto dying eyes

The casement slowly grows a glimmering square ;

So sad, sd strange, the days that are no more.

TENNYSON, The Princess.
