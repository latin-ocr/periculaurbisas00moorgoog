T RANSLA TIONS

XXVI. ’

I MET a tra'veller from an antique land,

Who said: ‘Two vast and trunkless legs oi stone
‘Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
‘Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose irown
‘And wrinkled lip and sneer oi cold command

‘Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
‘Which yet survive, stamped on these liseless things,
‘The hand that mocked thern, and the heart that led.
‘And on the pedestal these words appear:

“My name is Ozymandias, King of kings.

“‘ Look onlmy works‚ ye mighty‚ and despair !”
‘Nothing beside remains Round the decay

‘Os that colossal wreck boundless and bare

‘The lone and level sands stretch sar away.’ ⁵

SHELLEY‚ Sonnet.
