AND POEMS.

Of her ambition’s wildest deed:

Whose waming voice she would not heed.
But what ir years of fight and storrn

And pain have marred his wasted sorm,

¹ Pain that his country heeding not

Still bound him to the soldier's lot,

And what is power and same be fled ,²-
High Duty’s laws are never dead.

Lit by a flame within the heart,

They brighten never to depart.

'Tis Athens still that fills his sight,

And breathes within the undaunted might
To save the temnant os her host:

While lise remains, not all is lost

And now another morning shines

Upon their long retreating lines,
And loud the wail is heard again
From the death-cumbered shore and plain.

Onward with unaverted eyes

They pasS, where in the gateway lies

The abandoned crowd: they must not see
That last despairing agony;

Though oft a son’s or fathers groan

Is heard in answer to their own.

But others with last hope still strong

Are following, as they march along ;

And to their once-loved comrade clinging
