ΛΝΒ POEMS.

‘Are soaring now, for she has spent
‘Her last wrath on our armament,
‘And bears to the Olympian king

‘The tribute of long suffering ;

‘Nor can the offended Power deny

‘To humbled hearts security.

‘Look on yourselves: and chase Despair
‘From out those ranks still firm and sair
‘With discipline; where'er ye go, ’

¹ ·A city terrifies the soe,

‘Which towers can never fortify

‘As the brave soul and spirit high.
‘E’en- now from off her unmanned walls

‘Your own Athene loudly calls

Ἴ ‘Across the intervening main

‘ Her sons and ,city back again.
‘ Her breathing sons! her own dear band,
‘ She caIIS, the active heart and⁹ hand-
‘And not the hulks that strew yon strand!
‘Of naval pageantry bereft
‘ We, living sor our hearths, are les ,
‘And pressing on to friendly soil
‘Shall win the end of all· our toil?
ar ir ir r n
A few dayS, and the cup os death
Has stifled that heroic breath,

Drained in the dungeon house, to sate
Sicilia’s triumphant hate.
