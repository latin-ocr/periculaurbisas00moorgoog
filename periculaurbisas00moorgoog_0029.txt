n Tanusrnrrows ’

VI.

So SPAKE he, half in anger, half in scorn:

And one long cry of grief and of amaze

Broke from his sorrowing people ; so he spake3
And turning, left them there: and with brief pause,
Girt with anthrong of revellers, bent his way

To the cool region of the groves he loved.

There by the river banks he wandered on

From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,
Their smooth tops shining sunwards, and beneath
Burying their unsunned stems in grass and flowers;
Where in one dream the feverish time of Youth
Might fade in slumber, and the feet of Joy

Might wander all day long and never tire.

Here came the king, holding high feast at mom, r
Rose-crowned3 and ever when the sun went down
A hundred lamps¹ beamed in the tranquil gloom,
From tree to tree, all through the twinkling grove,
Revealing all the tumult of the feast,

Flushed guests, and golden goblets, foamed with wine,
While the deep-burnished foliage overhead
Splintered the silver arrows of the moon.

M. ARNOLD, M ycerz'nus.
