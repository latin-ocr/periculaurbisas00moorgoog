TRANSLA TIONS

IV.

SRONG god of arms! whose iron sceptre sways
The freezing north, and Hyperborean sem,

And Scythian coldS, and Thracia’s winter coast,
Where stand thy steeds‚ and thou art honoured most;
There most: but everywhere thy power is known,
The fortune os the fight is all thine own:

Terror is thine, and wild amazement flung

From out thy chariot withers e’en the strong;
And disarray and shameful rout ensue‚

And force is added to the sainting crew.
Acknowledged as thou art, accept my prayer

If aught 1 have achieved deserve thy care:

If to my utmost power with sword and shield

I dared the death unknowing how to yield,

And falling in my rank still kept the field: Ἰ

Then let my arms prevail, by thee'sustained,
That she I love by conquest may be gained. v

DRuoEN.
