XVIII.

Now is my love all ready sorth to come:
Let all the virgins therefore well awayt;
And ye fresh boyes, that tend upon her groome, ’
Prepare your selves ; for he is coming strayt.
Set all your things in seemely good array
Fit for so joyfull day:

The joyfullst day that ever sunne did see.

Loe where she comes along with portly pace,
Lyke Phoebe from her chamber of the east,
Arysing forth to run her mighty race,

Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best,

So well it her beseemeS, that ye would weene ⁵

Some angell she had beene.
