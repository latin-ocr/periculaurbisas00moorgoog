T RANSLA TIONS

The peaky islet shifted shapes,
High towns on hills were dimly seen,
We past long lines of northern capeS,
And dewy northern meadows green.
We came to warmer wave5‚ and deep
Across the boundless east we drove,
Where those long swells of breaker sweep
The nutmeg‘ rocks and isles of clove.

By peaks that flamed, or all in shade
Gloomed the low coast, and quivering brine

With ashy rainS, that spreading made

' Fantastic plume or sable pine;

By sands, and steaming flats, and floods

Os mighty mouth we scudded sest,
And hills, and scarlet-mingled woods
Gleamed for a moment as we past.

O hundred shores of happy climeS,

How swiftly streamed ye by the bark!
At times the whole sea burned; at times
Ἰ With wakes of fire we tore the dark:
At times a carven craft would shoot

From havens hid in fairy bowers,

With naked limbs, and flowers and fruit,
· But we nor paused for fruit nor flowers,
