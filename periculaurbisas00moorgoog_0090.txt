ΑΝΙ) POEMS.

Pierce through the dense-eniolding mist

That wraps rhem to the mountain breast:

Only from out the grey proiound ·
Is heard afar the cataract’s sound,

As rushing srom i'ts ae'ry steep

Onward it dashes to the deep.

But see! before advancing Day

The morning mists have rolled away;
And colours irorn that magio bearn
¹Flash out upon the winding stream,
And woods in untamed majesty

Toss their bright foliage to the sky,

. Where clear above the unnumbered throng
Sweer Philomel begins her song. ¹

But can the light on wood and river
Rekindle hopes now quenched ior ever?
The tears that blind the Athenian's eye-
Can they take pleasure from yon sky?
Or loves he now the sparkling wave
That rolls above his comrade's grave,
And driits toward the death-strewn shore
¹Each shattered trireme, mast, and oar,
And bursts in idly soaming spray
Far at the entrance oi the bay,

Where the chained galleyS, firm and high,
Deny him flight and liberty ?-
