’Twas Syracuse that bid him die,
Where ost in highest minstrelsy
His laureate harp had Pindar strung,

Ι And oft the banquet hails had rung

Loud with the song-inspired grace
That told os Hiero’s swift tace,
And welcomed in the enduring lay

v The victor of the bloodless bay.

But none os Graecia’s bards e'er shed
The light of song on Nicias' head,

Or let one tunesul teardrop sall

Upon his nameless funeral.

To captive wretch‚ what song is meet?
Who sings to chronicle defeat 2-
Enough sor him unknown tolie,

And silence hymn his victory.
