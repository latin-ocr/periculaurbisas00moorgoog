AND POEMS.

And sore he yearns to follow, and console

With kindly words the anguish of her soul ;

Yet to the fleet they launch upon the strand

He goes, unswerving to the God's command.

Then zeal was doubled in the Teucrian crew,

Then down the beach their towering ships they drew;
The pitch’d keels swarn: from forest depths they bore
The foliaged timber for the unhewn oar,

All eager to be sailing. From the town

Pours the whole tide of emigration down,

As when ants spoil a mighty pile of grain,

Their swarming armies blacken on the plain,

Ere winter come : some shoulder on the load

Of each huge grain along the narrow road ;

Some urge the straggling troops that move too slow,
And the whole path with bustle is aglow.

From her high turret Dido viewed the scene 3

Ah! then what pangs were thine, unhappy Queen?
What groanings thine when ocean and long shore
Stir, as thou look’st and send the mingled roar.

Ah! Love, thou moching fiend l thy magic arts

Stir to strange deeds the pulse of mortal hearts! ’
To tears again, to try how prayers may move,

She turns; and Anger must succumb to Love,

Lest she should die the death she must in vain,
While hope still lives, and aught untried remain.
