TRANSLA TIONS

ΙΙ.

BUT the crown
Os all my life was utmost quietude:
More did Ι love to lie in cavern rude,
Keeping in wait whole days sor Neptune's voice,
And if it came at last, hark and rejoice! ·
There blush'd no summer eve, but Ι would steer
My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear
The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,
Mingling with ceaseless bleatings of the sheep.
And never was a· day of summer shine
But l beheld its birth upon the brine:

For l would watch all night to see unfold

Heaven’s gates and AEthon snort his morning gold
Wide o’er the swelling streams: and constantly -

’ At brim of day-tide on some grassy lea

My nets would be spread out, and Ι at rest.
The poor solks of the sea country l blest

With daily boon of fish most delicate:

They knew not whence this bounty, and elate
Would strew swcet flowers upon a sterile beach

KEATS‚ Endymion.
