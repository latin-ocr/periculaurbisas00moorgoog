TRANSLA TIONS

Child! is the sun abroad? Ι feel my hair
Bome up and wasted by the gentle wind,

Ι feel the odours that perfume the air,

And hear the rustling os the leaves behind.
Within my heart I picture them, and then

Ι almost can iorget that I am blind,

And old, and hated by my fellow-men.

Yet would Ι sain once more behold the grace
Ol nature ere I die, and gaze again

Upon her living and rejoicing iace-

F ain would Ι see thy countenance, my child,
My comforter! I feel thy dear embrace—

Ι hear thy voice, so musical and mild,

The patient sole interpreter, by whom

So many years ol sadness are beguiled3

For it hath made my small and scanty room
Peopled with glorious visions of the past

But Ι will calmly hand me to my doom,

And wait the hour which is approaching fast,

When triple light shall stream upon mine eyes,

And heaven itseli be opened up at last
To him who dared ioretell its mysteries.
