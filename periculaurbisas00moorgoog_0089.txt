NICIAS.

rnucrnrnss v11. 75-8.

O’ER Athens’ columned citadels

κ And green Arcadia's shepherd dells,
O’er Sparta's rock-encircled valley,
And white sails of the bounding galley
That slowly breaks the Ionian foam‚
Straining for Hellas and sor home,
The Dawn is coming: on the flow

Os Western waves she reddens now,

V And burstir'rg upon Sicily

Her trembling purple floods the sky:

But untouched by her rosy fingers

On each dark hill the night-cloud lingers ;
Nor yet the rocks, where dews are streaming‚
Upon the precipice are gleaming;

Nor yet the pines-with sembre dress
Covering the craggy wilderness,

Where never climber dare intrude

On AEtna's fiery solitude—
