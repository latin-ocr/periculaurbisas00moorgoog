110 TRANSLA TIONS

By the wee birchen corries-lie patches os green,

Where gardens and bareheaded bairnies have been,

But the huts now are rickles of stones nettle-grown,

And the once human homeS, even their names are
unknown.

But the names that this side the Atlantic have
perished‚

'Mid sar western forests still dearly are cherished,

There men talk os each spot, on the hills that surround

Their long vanished dwellings, as paradise ground.

Not a pass in these hilis, not a caim, not a corrie,

But lives by the log·fire in legend and story;
And darkly the cloud on their countenance getherS,
As they think on the desolate homes os their fathers,

O hearts, to the hills os old mernory true,

In the land of your love thereare mourners sor you,
As they wander by peopleless lochside and glen,
Where the red deer are seeding o'er homesteads of
, rnen.
