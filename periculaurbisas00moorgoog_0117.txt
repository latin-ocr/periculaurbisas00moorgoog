108 T RANSLA TIONS

And she had died in drowsy ignorance,
But for a thing more deadly dari< than all ;
It came like a fierce potion‚ drunk by chance,

Which saves a sick man from the feathered pall

For some few gasping moments; like a lance
Waking an Indian srom his cloudy hall
‘With eniel pierce, and bringing him again
Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.
KEATs.
