In wailing ends its melancholy strains.

And wen she mnus the words of saintly men}

Spoken long since, though never ieared till then.
Distracted, in a wild career she seems

To fly the fierce AEneas in her dreams,

Or journeying far, companionless and slow,
Seeking her Tyrians through waste lands to go;
As in the mimic show mad Pentheus sees

The vengeful armies of the Eumenides

And Thebes shows double to his swimming gaze,
And double suns with double lustre blaze;

Or when the motheffs torch and serpents blaek
Fast o’er the stage pursue Orestes’ track,

He views, as saie he mounts the Pythian stair,
The ministers of vengeance crouching there.

Then, when the victirn oi love's agony

Conceives that irenzy, and decrees to die,

She clokes with deep dissimulating smile

The time and method she has planned the while :
Hope, bright and calm, upon her brow she wears,
And speaking, thus accosts her sister’s fears :-

³ 'Tis found! the charm this anguish to destroy,—
‘ Come, greet thy sister with a sisteris joy,-

‘ The churm to bring him to my side again,

‘ Or ever free me from my lovesick pain.

‘ By setting Suns and Ocean’s verge there lie

‘ Far Ethiop lands‚ where all the star-set sky
