TRANSLATION FROM THE FO URTH AENEID
OF VIRGIL.

(296-520.)

But Dido heard the whisper, ere they move,-
Ah! who may hope to dull the ear of love ?-
She knew the sure calm days were passing by,
And now the mischief Rumour swells the cry

of navies rigged, and crews prepared to fly.

F orth through the city she is raving now,
’ Pain at her heart, and sever on her brow,

As the wild Thyiad whom Iacchus' cry

And issuing dance encite to ecstacy,

When orgies end the long triennial round,
And midnight chantings from Cithaeron sound.

Then seeking out AEneaS, she 'began :-

‘ And did’st thou hope to hide it, treach'rous man?
‘Did'st hope to hide a deed like this from light,
‘And srorn my shores in silence steal thy flight? .
‘ Is our love nothing, and thy plighted saith,
‘ And Dido' dying an untimely death?
